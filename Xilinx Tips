# 生活小妙招

## 回读配置文件

Vivado® IDE can verify and/or readback the configuration data (i.e., .bit file) downloaded into an FPGA. When using write_bitstream to generate the .bit file, use the -mask_file option to create a corresponding mask (.msk) file. For more check UG908 Chapter 7.

Use the readback_hw_device Tcl command with at least one of the following options to read back the FPGA configuration data:

* To save readback data in ASCII format:

```tcl
-readback_file <filename.rbd>
```

* To saves readback data in binary format:

```tcl
readback_hw_device -bin_file <filename.bin>
```

Example: Readback FPGA configuration data in both ASCII and binary formats

```tcl
readback_hw_device [current_hw_device] \
-readback_file kcu105_cnt_ila_uncmpr_rb.rbd \
-bin_file kcu105_cnt_ila_uncmpr_rb.bin
```

Note:

1. Bitstream, and readback operations are done through the Tcl Console.
2. Verify and readback operations do not work for FPGAs programmed with encrypted bitstreams. Encrypted bitstreams contain commands that disable readback. Readback is re-enabled by pulsing the FPGA PROG pin, or if the FPGA/board is powered down and powered back up again.
3. The data readback using readback_hw_device contains configuration data only (no configuration commands are included).

Also you can refer to following [XAPP](https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/application_notes/xapp1230-configuration-readback-capture.pdf) for configuration readback.
